			Yes, you can now download the template for this very website!<br />
			Isn't that nice?<br />
			Well, I thought it was anyway.<br />
			But getting to the point, I'm releasing it under the GPL, which means you can use, modify etc. it all you like as long as you say 'I got it from that man.' (For details, see the GPL included in the zipfile.)<br />
			The site is made to allow for easy scaling and adding new stuff.<br />
			It requires php5 to be installed on the server you'll be hosting it on.(Even though it'll probably work fine with earlier version.)
			Other the php, it uses CSS and xhtml 1.1.<br />

			GTA Eemnes
		</p>
		<p class='items'>
			This is a total conversion mod for GTA 4. (At least, when we finish porting it from the San Andreas engine.)<br />
			Total conversion means that almost noting will be the same. New world, buildings, cars, charaters etc.<br />
			Just to explain; Eemnes is the town (sorry, city) the larger part of the team lives.<br />

			Insomnia BBS
		</p>
		<p class='items'>
			An old school, easy to run, easy to use BBS (Bulitin Board System) writen in Perl.<br />
			This was specificly made to have as little as possible overhead so it will run on just about anything that has Perl installed.
			So get your telnet clients out and dive into the past!<br />

			I don't have a distributable copy at this time, but for all you fans out there, he WILL be back.

			But what about that one thing I heard you were doing?

		<p class='items'>
			There's always tons of small projects that I'm working on, or stuff for University that I don't post here.<br />
			Either because it's not a perticularly good example, just not interersting, too small to mention here, I haven't had the time or whatever else.<br />
			If there is something you know I've been working on, feel free to contact me about it.<br />
			Either by e-mail, IRC, skype or whatever other methode you can find.<br />
